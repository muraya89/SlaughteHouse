		</h2>
		<div class="content">
		Animals are slaughtered according to the weekly slaughtering schedule. Following a post-mortem inspection, the carcases are chilled to a temperature throughout 
		the meat of not more than 3°C for Offal and 7°C for other meat. Meat shall only be dispatched once the whole carcase achieved these temperatures, and shall only 
		be dispatched onto refrigerated trucks which can ensure that those temperatures are maintained during transport.
